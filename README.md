# Netflix_Movies_And_TvShows_Clustering
Analyzed Netflix's 2019 dataset to uncover content trends and user preferences by using Unsupervised ML. Identified significant growth in TV shows and decline in movies since 2010, sourced from Flixable.

Used EDA (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib) to reveal insights into genre popularity, regional distribution, and content addition patterns. Utilized hypothesis testing, clustering techniques (K Means, Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering) to group content for further analysis.

We've opted for Silhouette Score as our evaluation metric as it is less influenced by the shape of the clusters &Â K-means clustering as our final model due to the comparatively high Silhouette Score and well-separated clusters observed in the three dimensions.

Developed a Recommendation System leveraging similarity scores to enhance user experience and reduce subscriber churn. Delivered personalized recommendations, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction on Netflix.
